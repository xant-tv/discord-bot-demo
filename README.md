# Discord Bot Demo
Basic skeleton for hosting a free discord bot.

## How This Works
Uses the free model of [Repl.it](https://repl.it/) to run a Discord bot written in NodeJS. 
Leverages [UptimeRobot](https://uptimerobot.com/) to ping the server and prevent hosting virtual machine from sleeping.

You don't need to do any of this if you can afford hosting instead. :thinking:
